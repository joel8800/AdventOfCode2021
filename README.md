# Advent of Code 2021
- Originally completed this season as part of a coding challenge at work.
- We were given a week to compleate each Day of AoC2021
- Completed nearly all of the puzzles on time as I was learning C# and VB.NET for first time.
- Redoing these puzzles to see if my current knowledge would lead me to do them differently or better.
